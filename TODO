"center" option (for block-level elements that span width of document)
"left", "right", and "center" options for bubble arrow placement

problematic situation
- step 2 is on a regular (non-fixed) element, but page is scrolled
- step 3 is on a fixed element
- if animate is set to true, it screws up.

support horizontal smooth scroll????????

NICETOHAVE:
===========
flag to see if user has already taken a tour?
support > 1 bubble at a time?
UI for multi-part steps
